      In the 1980s, computer technology was still in its infancy, but it was a time of rapid innovation and growth. From arcade games to the first personal computers, the 80s laid the groundwork for the digital age we live in today. Our goal is to celebrate this era and pay tribute to the pioneers who helped shape the world of technology.
